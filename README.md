# SuperTux Add-ons website

Currently under construction. Serves as an attempt to create a website, which people could register on and share, rate and browse Add-ons for [SuperTux](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux).

## How to run this website?

First, you need to run the testing back-end server for this site. It is stored in the "server/" directory, which contains further information on how to run it.

Afterwards, host everything else in this repository to run the front-end part of the website.
